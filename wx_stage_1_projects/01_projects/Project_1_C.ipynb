    "Using the R5IM signal, and dummy data of your own creation, you will research how to use existing python tools to define methods to identify \"sharp\" decrease in the R5IM (Intensity Monitor in super-period 5) signal. Decrease in intensity equates to lost protons. \"Sharp\" should be defined by the user, and thus you should investigate how to quantify and and allow the user to vary this.\n",

    "\n",
    "> In your groups:\n",
    "> - Start by planning your work\n",
    "> - You will need fundamental functions; try to plan what these should do, what arguments they should take, which should have default values (some default values will need research - ask us!), and what they should return. Don't forget to consider speed and the format of the data (float? int? array of floats? should the array be a certain length?...)\n",
    "> - Ask for feedback on your plan to save time\n",
    "> - Document your functions so others can understand / use / modify them\n",
    "> - Build more complex functions using the fundamental functions, this may require you to go back and modify the fundamental functions.\n",
    "> - Some things are suitable for objects (classes), others are not. Speed and accuracy are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> When coding a function (unless you have a preferred method):\n",
    "> 1. Plan your code in bullet points / pseudo-code\n",
    "> 2. Template your functions - put comments to say what you want to do\n",
    "> 3. Implement your code step-by-step. Pair programming here is your friend and will catch many mistakes, as well as give 2 people enough experience of the code to help debug it\n",
    "> 4. Test your code and document the testing\n",
    "> 5. Provide standard tests <b>only if requested by Haroon/Esher</b> (define an input with a known output and assert that it is the same, or within a tolerance)    \n",
    "> 6. Provide examples of use for each use case (different behaviour with optional arguments etc)\n",
    "> 7. Turn your functions into objects if suitable\n",
    "> 8. Get feedback from peers / supervisors / team-mates / users\n",
    "\n",
    "> - <b> Make a repository to hold your group project</b> (public so we can all access it at need), try to keep this well organised and easy to navigate / use / find something\n",
    "> - Make a Jupyter notebook for each investigation / function / method: such that future users (perhaps you) can use these notebooks to construct the code required to make future GUIs work\n",
    "> - Feel free to store individual work on your own 'dump' repository, and copy completed work to your group repository\n",
